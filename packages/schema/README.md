# MML Schema Definition

This directory contains the schema definition for the MML format. The schema is written in [XML Schema Definition Language (XSD)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/) as this enables validation of the source XHTML format of MML Documents.

**This is a work-in-progress even for v0.1 of the MML format.**

The schema definition of potentially difficult to parse as it makes use of attribute groups that allow attribute definition re-use across elements.

This package contains:
* [`mml.xsd`](./src/mml.xsd) - The MML Schema in XSD format
